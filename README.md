# tech-blog

## Description
I was tasked to create a full stack application for a tech-blog using express.js, handlebars, MySQL, and sequelize.

I was motivated to undertake this task because I wished to gain a greater understanding of how to connect the front-end and back-end of an application and build a polished full stack application.

## Solve
The completion of this project provides the user with a functional tech-blog where users can log in, create, edit, delete, and comment on articles.

## Installation
Steps to install this project on your local PC
1. Open the termal on your machine.
2. Use the terminal command `cd` to navigate to the directory where we want the repository located.
3. Locate the 'Code' button on the 'tech-blog' github repository, click it, then copy the 'HTTPS' link to clipboard. (See image)

4. Use the git command `git clone` followed by the URL copied from Github to clone the repo to our machine.
5. The `git clone` command creates a new directory with the same name as the repository. We navigate into our new directory using `cd`.
6. The repository should now be cloned onto your device and able to be edited in VScode or another editing software.
